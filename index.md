I'm camlyall, creator of this here site. Before you go any further, have you tried turning it off and on again? No, seriously...

Welcome to my notes. Hopefully they can be of some use to you. I have stored various notes and instructions that I use regularly. By the time you are seeing this they are likely out of date. I take no reponsiblility if these instructions make things worse üòÅ. Good luck.

## A quote from my favourite movie
*"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate,
Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.*

*It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us.
Your playing small does not serve the world.*

*There is nothing enlightened about shrinking
so that other people won‚Äôt feel insecure around you.*

*We were all meant to shine as children do.
It‚Äôs not just in some of us, it‚Äôs in everyone.*

*And, as we let our own light shine, we consciously give
other people permission to do the same.*

*As we are liberated from our fear,
our presence automatically liberates others."*
‚Äï Marianne Williamson
