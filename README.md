## Welcome to my notes

Hi!. I'm camlyall, have you tried turning it off and on again?

Welcome to my notes. Hopefully they can be of some use to you. Here, I will store various notes and instructions that I use regularly. By the time you are seeing this they are likely out of date. I take no reponsiblility if these instructions make things worse 😁. Good luck.

### A quote from my favourite movie
*"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate,
Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.*

*It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us.
Your playing small does not serve the world.*

*There is nothing enlightened about shrinking
so that other people won’t feel insecure around you.*

*We were all meant to shine as children do.
It’s not just in some of us, it’s in everyone.*

*And, as we let our own light shine, we consciously give
other people permission to do the same.*

*As we are liberated from our fear,
our presence automatically liberates others."*
